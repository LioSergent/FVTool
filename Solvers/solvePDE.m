function phi = solvePDE(MS, M, RHS, guess, solver_opts)
% SOLVEPDE solves the linear system M x \phi = RHS and returns the value of
% \phi reshaped based on the structure of the MeshStructure variable. The
% default solver is the matlab '\' linear solver and will be in most cases the
% best solver to use as it adapts to the type of matrix. In some cases others
% solvers can be explicitly used to inspect/debug numerical difficulties.
